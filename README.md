# decent-portal

This library contains functionality that can be added to a web app that the developer intends to deploy to the [Decent Portal](https://decentapps.net).

More specifically it includes:

* The Decent Bar, a React component that displays at the top of apps hosted on the Decent Portal.
* Scripts supporting deployment of the app to staging and production targets on the Decent Portal via Github actions.

The library is a dependency in project code generated by the [create-decent-app tool](https://github.com/erikh2000/create-decent-app). The CDA tool vendors (in-lines) most source code so that developers can directly edit it. But anticipating a need for updates around Decent Portal-related functionality, I created this separate library to make it easy for devs to upgrade.

The library allows for a single web app build that can simultaneously deploy to non-Decent-Portal hosting as well as the Decent Portal. The aim is to allow you to have a single build rather than multiple if that's what you want. So, for example, the Decent Bar can be configured to not render at run-time based on the domain it is hosted from.

## Design Conventions

* The library is just a library - not a framework. It should be easy to add to/remove from a project.
* No dependencies other than React and ReactDOM.
* CSS is defined in CSS modules with component scope. No global CSS, other than explicit imports.
* The scope of functionality is limited to things that are specific to Decent Portal.
